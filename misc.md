### Ways to Improve your Website

[20 Ways to Improve your Website](https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/speed-up-your-website/)

Average Stats to Ponder:

```
A one-second delay in page load time yields:

11% fewer page views
16% decrease in customer satisfaction
7% loss in conversions

Slow speeds kill conversions.

In fact, 47% of consumers expect websites to load in two seconds or less — and 40% will abandon a page that takes three or more seconds.

This means that if your site takes more than three seconds to load, you lose almost half of your visitors before they even arrive on your site.

That alone is a huge blow to your potential conversions.

At the end of their website speed optimization, Walmart reported the following results:

For every one second of improvement they experienced up to a 2% increase in conversions.
For every 100 ms of improvement, they grew incremental revenue by up to 1%.
In another study, the relationship between load times and conversion rates showed a 25% decrease in conversion rates with just one extra second of load time.

Consider that Google once experienced a 20% drop in traffic because of an extra .5 seconds in load time.

#### What is a good load time?

```
Before you start working on your site’s speed, it’s a good idea to set a goal for where you want it to be.

That can be difficult if you aren’t sure what an acceptable page speed is.

According to Google, best practice is three seconds. Unfortunately, according to its recent benchmark report findings, most sites are nowhere near that.

In an analysis of 900,000 mobile ad landing pages spanning 126 countries, Google found that 70% of the pages analyzed took nearly seven seconds for the visual content above the fold to display.
