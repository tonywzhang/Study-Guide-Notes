## Graphs Notes

A graph is similar to a tree, in that it is a collection of objects or entities that we call nodes or vertices connected to each other through a set of edges. In a tree, there are restrictions on the way nodes/vertices are connected.

For example, if we have a tree with N nodes, we must have N-1 number of edges. We must have one edge for each parent-child relationship. Each node except the very root node will have an edge to it's parent.

* How do we define a graph, and where are they commonly used?
  * In mathematics, graphs are a way to formally represent a network, which is basically a collection of objects that are all inter-connected.
  * G = (V,E) where V is a set of nodes, also called vertices
  * E is a set of edges, also called links.

* What are the specific attributes that graphs can have, and how do we talk about them?
