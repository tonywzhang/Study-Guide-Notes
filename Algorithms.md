## Graphs Notes

A graph is similar to a tree, in that it is a collection of objects or entities that we call nodes or vertices connected to each other through a set of edges. In a tree, there are restrictions on the way nodes/vertices are connected.

For example, if we have a tree with N nodes, we must have N-1 number of edges. We must have one edge for each parent-child relationship. Each node except the very root node will have an edge to it's parent.

* How do we define a graph, and where are they commonly used?
  * In mathematics, graphs are a way to formally represent a network, which is basically a collection of objects that are all inter-connected.
  * G = (V,E) where V is a set of nodes, also called vertices
  * E is a set of edges, also called links.


* What are the specific attributes that graphs can have, and how do we talk about them?
  * Graphs may have directed or undirected edges. Directed graphs have one directional edges, whereas undirected graphs have bi-directional edges.


* What are some ways we might store a graph in memory? What space/time complexity problems might we face?
  * If we store a graph in memory as nodes with pointers to one another, the space complexity is O(n) depending on the total number of nodes we have.
  * The number of pointers required is O(n^2)



* REST (Representation State Transfer) is a term we have thrown around a lot in the course.

  * It is a set of design principles for making network communication more scalable and flexible.
  * These principles answer a number of questions.
  * What are the components of the system?
  * How should they communicate with each other?
  * How do we ensure we can swap out different parts of the system at any time?
  * How can the system be scaled up to serve billions of users?



## Stateless

Stateless does not mean that servers and clients do not have state, it simply means that they do not need to keep track of each otherâ€™s state. When a client is not interacting with the server, the server has no idea of its existence. The server also does not keep a record of past requests. Each request is treated as a standalone.

## JavaScript

Prototypes are a fundamental feature of Javascript. Given this topic's importance to the language, they are a very hot interview/phone screen topic. Having a strong grasp on Javascript Prototypes will give you a major leg-up in the application process.
