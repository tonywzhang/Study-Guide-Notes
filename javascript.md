# JavaScript Notes

## JavaScript

Prototypes are a fundamental feature of Javascript. Given this topic's importance to the language, they are a very hot interview/phone screen topic. Having a strong grasp on Javascript Prototypes will give you a major leg-up in the application process.

## Types && Coercion

There are 7 built-in types: null, undefined, boolean, string, number, object, and symbol.

All of the aforementioned types, aside from object, are primitives.

```
typeof 0              // number
typeof true           // boolean
typeof 'Hello'        // string
typeof Math           // object
typeof null           // object  !!
typeof Symbol('Hi')   // symbol (New ES6)
```

### Null vs Undefined

Undefined is the absence of a definition. It is used as the default value for uninitialized variables, function arguments that were not provided and missing properties of objects. Functions return undefined when nothing has been explicitly returned.

Null is the absence of a value. It is an assignment value that can be assigned to a variable as a representation of ‘no-value’.

### Falsey Values

```
Falsy values: "", 0, null, undefined, NaN, false.

Anything not explicitly on the falsy list is truthy — boolean coerced to true.
```

### String & Number coercion

The first thing you need to be aware of is the + operator. This is a tricky operator because it works for both number addition and string concatenation.

But, the star symbol, / , and -operators are exclusive for numeric operations. When these operators are used with a string, it forces the string to be coerced to a number.


```
1 + "2" = "12"
"" + 1 + 0 = "10"
"" - 1 + 0 = -1
"-9\n" + 5 = "-9\n5"
"-9\n" - 5 = -14
"2" * "3" = 6
4 + 5 + "px" = "9px"
"$" + 4 + 5 = "$45"
"4" - 2 = 2
"4px" - 2 = NaN
null + 1 = 1
undefined + 1 = NaN
```

### == vs. ===
It is widely spread that == checks for equality and === checks for equality and type. Well, that is a misconception.

In fact, == checks for equality with coercion and === checks for equality without coercion — strict equality.
