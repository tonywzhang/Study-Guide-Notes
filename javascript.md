# JavaScript Notes

## JavaScript

Prototypes are a fundamental feature of Javascript. Given this topic's importance to the language, they are a very hot interview/phone screen topic. Having a strong grasp on Javascript Prototypes will give you a major leg-up in the application process.

## Types && Coercion

There are 7 built-in types: null, undefined, boolean, string, number, object, and symbol.

All of the aforementioned types, aside from object, are primitives.

```
typeof 0              // number
typeof true           // boolean
typeof 'Hello'        // string
typeof Math           // object
typeof null           // object  !!
typeof Symbol('Hi')   // symbol (New ES6)
```

### Null vs Undefined

Undefined is the absence of a definition. It is used as the default value for uninitialized variables, function arguments that were not provided and missing properties of objects. Functions return undefined when nothing has been explicitly returned.

Null is the absence of a value. It is an assignment value that can be assigned to a variable as a representation of ‘no-value’.

### Falsey Values

```
Falsy values: "", 0, null, undefined, NaN, false.

Anything not explicitly on the falsy list is truthy — boolean coerced to true.
```

### String & Number coercion

The first thing you need to be aware of is the + operator. This is a tricky operator because it works for both number addition and string concatenation.

But, the star symbol, / , and -operators are exclusive for numeric operations. When these operators are used with a string, it forces the string to be coerced to a number.


```
1 + "2" = "12"
"" + 1 + 0 = "10"
"" - 1 + 0 = -1
"-9\n" + 5 = "-9\n5"
"-9\n" - 5 = -14
"2" * "3" = 6
4 + 5 + "px" = "9px"
"$" + 4 + 5 = "$45"
"4" - 2 = 2
"4px" - 2 = NaN
null + 1 = 1
undefined + 1 = NaN
```

### == vs. ===

It is widely spread that == checks for equality and === checks for equality and type. Well, that is a misconception.

In fact, == checks for equality with coercion and === checks for equality without coercion — strict equality.

```
2 == '2'            // True
2 === '2'           // False
undefined == null   // True
undefined === null  // False
```

Some tricky comparisons to look out for:

```
false == ""  // true
false == []  // true
false == {}  // false
"" == 0      // true
"" == []     // true
"" == {}     // false
0 == []      // true
0 == {}      // false
0 == null    // false
```
### Value vs Reference

Simple values (also known as primitives) are always assigned by value-copy: null, undefined , boolean, number, string and ES6 symbol.

```
var a = 2;        // 'a' hold a copy of the value 2.
var b = a;        // 'b' is always a copy of the value in 'a'
b++;
console.log(a);   // 2
console.log(b);   // 3
var c = [1,2,3];
var d = c;        // 'd' is a reference to the shared value
d.push( 4 );      // Mutates the referenced value (object)
console.log(c);   // [1,2,3,4]
console.log(d);   // [1,2,3,4]
/* Compound values are equal by reference */
var e = [1,2,3,4];
console.log(c === d);  // true
console.log(c === e);  // false
```

### Scope

Scope refers to the execution context. It defines the accessibility of variables and functions in the code.

Global Scope is the outermost scope. Variables declared outside a function are in the global scope and can be accessed in any other scope. In a browser, the window object is the global scope.

Local Scope is a scope nested inside another function scope. Variables declared in a local scope are accessible within this scope as well as in any inner scopes.

```
function outer() {
  let a = 1;
  function inner() {
    let b = 2;
    function innermost() {
      let c = 3;
      console.log(a, b, c);   // 1 2 3
    }
    innermost();
    console.log(a, b);        // 1 2 — 'c' is not defined
  }
  inner();
  console.log(a);             // 1 — 'b' and 'c' are not defined
}
outer();
```

You may think of Scopes as a series of doors decreasing in size (from biggest to smallest). A short person that fits through the smallest door — innermost scope — also fits through any bigger doors — outer scopes.

### Hoisting

The behavior of “moving” var and function declarations to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase is called hoisting.

Function declarations are completely hoisted. This means that a declared function can be called before it is defined.

```
console.log(toSquare(3));  // 9

function toSquare(n){
  return n*n;
}
```

let and const are not hoisted. var is hoisted

```
{  /* Original code */
  console.log(i);  // undefined
  var i = 10
  console.log(i);  // 10
}

{  /* Compilation phase */
  var i;
  console.log(i);  // undefined
  i = 10
  console.log(i);  // 10
}
// ES6 let & const
{
  console.log(i);  // ReferenceError: i is not defined
  const i = 10
  console.log(i);  // 10
}
{
  console.log(i);  // ReferenceError: i is not defined
  let i = 10
  console.log(i);  // 10
}
```

### Function Expression vs Function Declaration

#### Function Expression

A Function Expression is created when the execution reaches it and is usable from then on — it is not hoisted.

```
var sum = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

#### Function Declaration
A Function Declaration can be called both before and after it was defined — it is hoisted.

```
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

### Variables: var, let and const

Before ES6, it was only possible to declare a variable using var. Variables and functions declared inside another function cannot be accessed by any of the enclosing scopes — they are function-scoped.

Variables declared inside a block-scope, such as if statements and for loops, can be accessed from outside of the opening and closing curly braces of the block.

Note: An undeclared variable — assignment without var, let or const — creates a var variable in global scope.

```
function greeting() {
  console.log(s) // undefined
  if(true) {
    var s = 'Hi';
    undeclaredVar = 'I am automatically created in global scope';
  }
  console.log(s) // 'Hi'
}
console.log(s);  // Error — ReferenceError: s is not defined
greeting();
console.log(undeclaredVar) // 'I am automatically created in global scope'
```

ES6 let and const are new. They are not hoisted and block-scoped alternatives for variable declaration. This means that a pair of curly braces define a scope in which variables declared with either let or const are confined in.

```
let g1 = 'global 1'
let g2 = 'global 2'
{   /* Creating a new block scope */
  g1 = 'new global 1'
  let g2 = 'local global 2'
  console.log(g1)   // 'new global 1'
  console.log(g2)   // 'local global 2'
  console.log(g3)   // ReferenceError: g3 is not defined
  let g3 = 'I am not hoisted';
}
console.log(g1)    // 'new global 1'
console.log(g2)    // 'global 2'
```

### Closures

A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment from which it was declared. Closure allows a function to access variables from an enclosing scope — environment — even after it leaves the scope in which it was declared.

```
function sayHi(name){
  var message = `Hi ${name}!`;
  function greeting() {
    console.log(message)
  }
  return greeting
}
var sayHiToJon = sayHi('Jon');
console.log(sayHiToJon)     // ƒ() { console.log(message) }
console.log(sayHiToJon())   // 'Hi Jon!'
```

Refers to variables in outer scope.

One of the main benefits of closures is that it allows data encapsulation. This refers to the idea that some data should not be directly exposed. The following example illustrates that.

### Immediate Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)

An IIFE is a function expression that is called immediately after you define it. It is usually used when you want to create a new variable scope.

On IIFE you are calling the function exactly when you are defining it.

```
var result = [];
for (var i=0; i < 5; i++) {
  result.push( function() { return i } );
}
console.log( result[1]() ); // 5
console.log( result[3]() ); // 5
result = [];
for (var i=0; i < 5; i++) {
  (function () {
    var j = i; // copy current value of i
    result.push( function() { return j } );
  })();
}
console.log( result[1]() ); // 1
console.log( result[3]() ); // 3
```

### Context

Context is often confused as the same thing as Scope.

To clear things up, lets keep the following in mind:

Context is most often determined by how a function is invoked. It always refers to the value of this in a particular part of your code.

Scope refers to the visibility of variables.

### Function calls: call, apply and bind

All of these three methods are used to attach this into function and the difference is in the function invocation.

.call() invokes the function immediately and requires you to pass in arguments as a list (one by one).

.apply() invokes the function immediately and allows you to pass in arguments as an array.

.call() and .apply() are mostly equivalent and are used to borrow a method from an object. Choosing which one to use depends on which one is easier to pass the arguments in. Just decide whether it’s easier to pass in an array or a comma separated list of arguments.

.bind() returns a new function, with a certain context and parameters. It is usually used when you want a function to be called later with a certain context.

That is possible thanks to its ability to maintain a given context for calling the original function. This is useful for asynchronous callbacks and events.

.bind() works like the call function. It requires you to pass in the arguments one by one separated by a comma.

### 'this' keyword

Understanding the keyword this in JavaScript, and what it is referring to, can be quite complicated at times.

The value of this is usually determined by a functions execution context. Execution context simply means how a function is called.

The keyword this acts as a placeholder, and will refer to whichever object called that method when the method is actually used.

.bind() works a little bit differently. It creates a new function that will call the original one with the object that was bound to it.

### Strict Mode

JavaScript is executed in strict mode by using the “use strict” directive. Strict mode tightens the rules for parsing and error handling on your code.

Some of its benefits are:

* Makes debugging easier — Code errors that would otherwise have been ignored will now generate errors, such as assigning to non-writable global or property.
* Prevents accidental global variables — Assigning a value to an undeclared variable will now throw an error.
* Prevents invalid use of delete — Attempts to delete variables, functions and undeletable properties will now throw an error.
* Prevents duplicate property names or parameter values — Duplicated named property in an object or argument in a function will now throw an error. (This is no longer the case in ES6)
* Makes eval() safer — Variables and functions declared inside an eval() statement are not created in the surrounding scope.
* “Secures” JavaScript eliminating this coercion — Referencing a this value of null or undefined is not coerced to the global object. This means that in browsers it’s no longer possible to reference the window object using this inside a function.

### Prototype and Inheritance

Prototype is one of the most confusing concepts in JavaScript and one of the reason for that is because there are two different contexts in which the word prototype is used.

#### Prototype relationship
Each object has a prototype object, from which it inherits all of its prototype’s properties.
__proto__ is a non-standard mechanism (available in ES6) for retrieving the prototype of an object. It points to the object’s “parent” — the object’s prototype.

All normal objects also inherit a .constructor property that points to the constructor of the object. Whenever an object is created from a constructor function, the __proto__ property links that object to the .prototype property of the constructor function used to create it.

Object.getPrototypeOf()is the standard ES5 function for retrieving the prototype of an object.

#### Prototype property
Every function has a .prototype property.
It references to an object used to attach properties that will be inherited by objects further down the prototype chain. This object contains, by default, a .constructor property that points to the original constructor function.
Every object created with a constructor function inherits a constructor property that points back to that function.

```
function Dog(breed, name){
  this.breed = breed,
  this.name = name
}
Dog.prototype.describe = function() {
  console.log(`${this.name} is a ${this.breed}`)
}
const rusty = new Dog('Beagle', 'Rusty');

/* .prototype property points to an object which has constructor and attached
properties to be inherited by objects created by this constructor. */
console.log(Dog.prototype)  // { describe: ƒ , constructor: ƒ }

/* Object created from Dog constructor function */
console.log(rusty)   //  { breed: "Beagle", name: "Rusty" }
/* Object inherited properties from constructor function's prototype */
console.log(rusty.describe())   // "Rusty is a Beagle"
/* .__proto__ property points to the .prototype property of the constructor function */
console.log(rusty.__proto__)    // { describe: ƒ , constructor: ƒ }
/* .constructor property points to the constructor of the object */
console.log(rusty.constructor)  // ƒ Dog(breed, name) { ... }
```

#### Prototype Chain

The prototype chain is a series of links between objects that reference one another.

When looking for a property in an object, JavaScript engine will first try to access that property on the object itself.

If it is not found, the JavaScript engine will look for that property on the object it inherited its properties from — the object’s prototype.

The engine will traverse up the chain looking for that property and return the first one it finds.

The last object in the chain is the built-in Object.prototype, which has null as its prototype. Once the engine reaches this object, it returns undefined.

#### Own vs Inherited Properties

Objects have own properties and inherited properties.

Own properties are properties that were defined on the object.

Inherited properties were inherited through prototype chain.

```
function Car() { }
Car.prototype.wheels = 4;
Car.prototype.airbags = 1;

var myCar = new Car();
myCar.color = 'black';

/*  Check for Property including Prototype Chain:  */
console.log('airbags' in myCar)  // true
console.log(myCar.wheels)        // 4
console.log(myCar.year)          // undefined

/*  Check for Own Property:  */
console.log(myCar.hasOwnProperty('airbags'))  // false — Inherited
console.log(myCar.hasOwnProperty('color'))    // true
```

Object.create(obj) — Creates a new object with the specified prototype object and properties.

```
var dog = { legs: 4 };
var myDog = Object.create(dog);

console.log(myDog.hasOwnProperty('legs'))  // false
console.log(myDog.legs)                    // 4
console.log(myDog.__proto__ === dog)       // true
```

#### Inheritance by Reference

An inherited property is a copy by reference of the prototype object’s property from which it inherited that property.

If an object’s property is mutated on the prototype, objects which inherited that property will share the same mutation. But if the property is replaced, the change will not be shared.

```
var objProt = { text: 'original' };
var objAttachedToProt = Object.create(objProt);
console.log(objAttachedToProt.text)   // original

objProt.text = 'prototype property changed';
console.log(objAttachedToProt.text)   // prototype property changed

objProt = { text: 'replacing property' };
console.log(objAttachedToProt.text)   // prototype property changed
```

### Event Loop Lecture Notes

JavaScript is a single threaded programming language. It can only run one thing at a time.

The call stack is a data structure that records where in the program we are.

The heap is where memory allocation happens.

The call stack is where the stack frames.

However, if you clone the V8 code base, and search all files using grep for setTimeout, DOM, or HTTP Request, those searches return empty.

We have our Web APIs, web services that hold the DOM, time out, AJAX, etc.
